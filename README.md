# README - Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## Background
The data, supplied by UCI, contains accelerometer measurements from a Samsung 
Galaxy S smartphone while the wearer executes a series of activities. 
Descriptions of the measurements are available in the 'features_info.txt' file. 
70% of the records are split into a training set and the remaining 30% make up
the test set. Additional tables specify which activity is occurring and by whom.
 
More information is available [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

## Objective
The purpose of this project is to collect data and rearrange it into a tidy form
for analysis.

You should create one R script called 'run_analysis.R' that does the following: 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each 
measurement. 

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with
 the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
